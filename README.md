# Star trek voyager reviews
### episode 1: the pilot

##### This a fantastic episode of star trek voyager and forms the beginning of a brilliant series . Voyager, a small speedy ship with a smart female captain who is ready for anything. A good Vulcan tactical officer and the best star ship pilot the galaxy has ever seen on board. Whizzing and whirling through space voyager is going to rescue their tactic officer tvock currently spying on a marquis ship. Voyager followed them through the Badlands where they get hit by a subspace wave and transported to the other side of the galaxy. I would rate this episode 5 stars. Overall it was a very good beginning.
